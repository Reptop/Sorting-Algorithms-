A methodolog assists in probing the reasearch question itself i.e. it's an "attack plan" for answering the question itself. It 
also helps in identifying which sources are essential for answering the question, hence, if you have no methodology, then you 
don't know if you have the right sources that can answer the reasearch question.

1. A computer science EE permites the use of analyzing already existing programs; thus, I will analyze the efficency of other 
programmer's algorithms, as programming sorting algorithms myself would lead to the same product as using pre existing open
source resources. 
3. I will establish my variables before I begin to analyze the algorithm efficency, which will be the constants, Dv, and IV;
the DV being the time it takes for the algorithm to complete, while the IV is the specific properties of the input data. The 
constant, however, are multiple factors: the computer hardware and operating system, the specific development environment used,
the same algorithms used, same functions being called, and same input data type, which is an "int." 
2. Before conducting any experiments, I will make a hypothesis, afterwards, I will move forward with the experiment by using the C++ <chrono> library, I will measure the time if takes for each type of algorithms to fully sort an array of 
numbers ranging in different properties.  
3. I will examine the results and use a source from khan academy that explains how to derive time complexity from the results; a 
graph will also be used to analyze the experiment's results.
4. I will interpret the created graph and verify if the results differ from my hypothesis or not; whatever the results may be, I will use academic articles written by MIT professors, which explains why a time complexity changes based in certain scenarios.
5. I will finally derive a conclusion from the
